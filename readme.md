# Car Registration Plate Dataset

## About

This dataset contains 345 image and label pairs of Bangladeshi car registration plates; 315 of the pairs are for training, and 30 of them are for testing.

## Images

Each image contains registration plate[s], most of them being embedded in a vehicle, especially a car.

## Labels

The labels here are essentially bounding boxes which define the rectangular space occupied by registration plates. Each label is defined as an XML document; containing the 2D coordinates of the top-left point of the bounding box, along with its width and height.
